summary: "Get authentication status"
description: |
  This is the endpoint to start authentication. If you're already
  authenticated, then then this returns the information such as
  user id.

  If you're not yet authenticated, this will return an `auth_link`
  which you need to open on a browser. You need to authorize this app.
  After authorization, Plurk will forward you to a url where this app
  will display your `oauth-token` and `oauth-secret`. You need to add
  this to the header of every request that requires authentication.
  Using the swagger UI, there is an `Authorize` button at the top-left
  of the page where you can assign it to the headers of your subsequent
  requests. This is not a persistent data and will be reset once you
  refresh the page.
